    <p>Because the string &quot;</script>&quot; is included with <code>document.write()</code>,
    the script tag is closed before reaching its natural end. That means you'll see some extra
    text here:</p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write("<script type=\"text\javascript\" src=\"file.js\">" +   
            "</script>");
    </script>
</body>
